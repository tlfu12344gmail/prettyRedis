 <p>Kills the currently executing Lua script, assuming no write operation was yet performed by the script.</p> 
 <p>This command is mainly useful to kill a script that is running for too much time(for instance because it entered an infinite loop because of a bug). The script will be killed and the client currently blocked into EVAL will see the command returning with an error.</p> 
 <p>If the script already performed write operations it can not be killed in this way because it would violate Lua script atomicity contract. In such a case only <code>SHUTDOWN NOSAVE</code> is able to kill the script, killing the Redis process in an hard way preventing it to persist with half-written information.</p> 
 <p>Please refer to the <span href="/commands/eval">EVAL</span> documentation for detailed information about Redis Lua scripting.</p>
