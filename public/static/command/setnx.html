 <h2><span href="#design-pattern-locking-with-codesetnxcode" class="anchor-link"></span>Design pattern: Locking with <code>SETNX</code></h2> 
 <p><strong>Please note that:</strong></p> 
 <ol> 
  <li>The following pattern is discouraged in favor of <span href="https://redis.io/topics/distlock">the Redlock algorithm</span> which is only a bit more complex to implement, but offers better guarantees and is fault tolerant.</li> 
  <li>We document the old pattern anyway because certain existing implementations link to this page as a reference. Moreover it is an interesting example of how Redis commands can be used in order to mount programming primitives.</li> 
  <li>Anyway even assuming a single-instance locking primitive, starting with 2.6.12 it is possible to create a much simpler locking primitive, equivalent to the one discussed here, using the <span href="/commands/set">SET</span> command to acquire the lock, and a simple Lua script to release the lock. The pattern is documented in the <span href="/commands/set">SET</span> command page.</li> 
 </ol> 
 <p>That said, <span href="/commands/setnx">SETNX</span> can be used, and was historically used, as a locking primitive. For example, to acquire the lock of the key <code>foo</code>, the client could try the following:</p> 
 <pre><code>SETNX lock.foo &lt;current Unix time + lock timeout + 1&gt;
</code></pre> 
 <p>If <span href="/commands/setnx">SETNX</span> returns <code>1</code> the client acquired the lock, setting the <code>lock.foo</code> key to the Unix time at which the lock should no longer be considered valid. The client will later use <code>DEL lock.foo</code> in order to release the lock.</p> 
 <p>If <span href="/commands/setnx">SETNX</span> returns <code>0</code> the key is already locked by some other client. We can either return to the caller if it's a non blocking lock, or enter a loop retrying to hold the lock until we succeed or some kind of timeout expires.</p> 
 <span id="handling-deadlocks" class="anchor"></span>
 <h3><span href="#handling-deadlocks" class="anchor-link"></span>Handling deadlocks</h3> 
 <p>In the above locking algorithm there is a problem: what happens if a client fails, crashes, or is otherwise not able to release the lock? It's possible to detect this condition because the lock key contains a UNIX timestamp. If such a timestamp is equal to the current Unix time the lock is no longer valid.</p> 
 <p>When this happens we can't just call <span href="/commands/del">DEL</span> against the key to remove the lock and then try to issue a <span href="/commands/setnx">SETNX</span>, as there is a race condition here, when multiple clients detected an expired lock and are trying to release it.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>C1 and C2 read <code>lock.foo</code> to check the timestamp, because they both received <code>0</code> after executing <span href="/commands/setnx">SETNX</span>, as the lock is still held by C3 that crashed after holding the lock.</li> 
  <li>C1 sends <code>DEL lock.foo</code></li> 
  <li>C1 sends <code>SETNX lock.foo</code> and it succeeds</li> 
  <li>C2 sends <code>DEL lock.foo</code></li> 
  <li>C2 sends <code>SETNX lock.foo</code> and it succeeds</li> 
  <li><strong>ERROR</strong>: both C1 and C2 acquired the lock because of the race condition.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Fortunately, it's possible to avoid this issue using the following algorithm. Let's see how C4, our sane client, uses the good algorithm:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li><p>C4 sends <code>SETNX lock.foo</code> in order to acquire the lock</p></li> 
  <li><p>The crashed client C3 still holds it, so Redis will reply with <code>0</code> to C4.</p></li> 
  <li><p>C4 sends <code>GET lock.foo</code> to check if the lock expired. If it is not, it will sleep for some time and retry from the start.</p></li> 
  <li><p>Instead, if the lock is expired because the Unix time at <code>lock.foo</code> is older than the current Unix time, C4 tries to perform:</p> <pre><code>GETSET lock.foo &lt;current Unix timestamp + lock timeout + 1&gt;
</code></pre></li> 
  <li><p>Because of the <span href="/commands/getset">GETSET</span> semantic, C4 can check if the old value stored at <code>key</code> is still an expired timestamp. If it is, the lock was acquired.</p></li> 
  <li><p>If another client, for instance C5, was faster than C4 and acquired the lock with the <span href="/commands/getset">GETSET</span> operation, the C4 <span href="/commands/getset">GETSET</span> operation will return a non expired timestamp. C4 will simply restart from the first step. Note that even if C4 set the key a bit a few seconds in the future this is not a problem.</p></li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>In order to make this locking algorithm more robust, a client holding a lock should always check the timeout didn't expire before unlocking the key with <span href="/commands/del">DEL</span> because client failures can be complex, not just crashing but also blocking a lot of time against some operations and trying to issue <span href="/commands/del">DEL</span> after a lot of time (when the LOCK is already held by another client).</p>
