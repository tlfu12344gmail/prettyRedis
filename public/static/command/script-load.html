  <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(N) with N being the length in bytes of the script body.</p> 
 </div> 
 <p>Load a script into the scripts cache, without executing it. After the specified command is loaded into the script cache it will be callable using <span href="/commands/evalsha">EVALSHA</span> with the correct SHA1 digest of the script, exactly like after the first successful invocation of <span href="/commands/eval">EVAL</span>.</p> 
 <p>The script is guaranteed to stay in the script cache forever (unless <code>SCRIPT FLUSH</code> is called).</p> 
 <p>The command works in the same way even if the script was already present in the script cache.</p> 
 <p>Please refer to the <span href="/commands/eval">EVAL</span> documentation for detailed information about Redis Lua scripting.</p>
