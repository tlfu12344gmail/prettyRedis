 <p>Select the Redis logical database having the specified zero-based numeric index. New connections always use the database 0.</p> 
 <p>Selectable Redis databases are a form of namespacing: all databases are still persisted in the same RDB / AOF file. However different databases can have keys with the same name, and commands like <span href="/commands/flushdb">FLUSHDB</span>, <span href="/commands/swapdb">SWAPDB</span> or <span href="/commands/randomkey">RANDOMKEY</span> work on specific databases.</p> 
 <p>In practical terms, Redis databases should be used to separate different keys belonging to the same application (if needed), and not to use a single Redis instance for multiple unrelated applications.</p> 
 <p>When using Redis Cluster, the <span href="/commands/select">SELECT</span> command cannot be used, since Redis Cluster only supports database zero. In the case of a Redis Cluster, having multiple databases would be useless and an unnecessary source of complexity. Commands operating atomically on a single database would not be possible with the Redis Cluster design and goals.</p> 
 <p>Since the currently selected database is a property of the connection, clients should track the currently selected database and re-select it on reconnection. While there is no command in order to query the selected database in the current connection, the <span href="/commands/client-list">CLIENT LIST</span> output shows, for each client, the currently selected database.</p>
