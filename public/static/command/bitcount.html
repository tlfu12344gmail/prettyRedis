 <p>Count the number of set bits (population counting) in a string.</p> 
 <p>By default all the bytes contained in the string are examined. It is possible to specify the counting operation only in an interval passing the additional arguments <em>start</em> and <em>end</em>.</p> 
 <p>Like for the <span href="/commands/getrange">GETRANGE</span> command start and end can contain negative values in order to index bytes starting from the end of the string, where -1 is the last byte, -2 is the penultimate, and so forth.</p> 
 <p>Non-existent keys are treated as empty strings, so the command will return zero.</p>

 <h2><span href="#pattern-real-time-metrics-using-bitmaps" class="anchor-link"></span>Pattern: real-time metrics using bitmaps</h2> 
 <p>Bitmaps are a very space-efficient representation of certain kinds of information. One example is a Web application that needs the history of user visits, so that for instance it is possible to determine what users are good targets of beta features.</p> 
 <p>Using the <span href="/commands/setbit">SETBIT</span> command this is trivial to accomplish, identifying every day with a small progressive integer. For instance day 0 is the first day the application was put online, day 1 the next day, and so forth.</p> 
 <p>Every time a user performs a page view, the application can register that in the current day the user visited the web site using the <span href="/commands/setbit">SETBIT</span> command setting the bit corresponding to the current day.</p> 
 <p>Later it will be trivial to know the number of single days the user visited the web site simply calling the <span href="/commands/bitcount">BITCOUNT</span> command against the bitmap.</p> 
 <p>A similar pattern where user IDs are used instead of days is described in the article called "<span href="http://blog.getspool.com/2011/11/29/fast-easy-realtime-metrics-using-redis-bitmaps">Fast easy realtime metrics using Redis bitmaps</span>".</p> 
 <span id="performance-considerations" class="anchor"></span>
 <h2><span href="#performance-considerations" class="anchor-link"></span>Performance considerations</h2> 
 <p>In the above example of counting days, even after 10 years the application is online we still have just <code>36510</code> bits of data per user, that is just 456 bytes per user. With this amount of data <span href="/commands/bitcount">BITCOUNT</span> is still as fast as any other <span class="math">O(1) </span>Redis command like <span href="/commands/get">GET</span> or <span href="/commands/incr">INCR</span>.</p> 
 <p>When the bitmap is big, there are two alternatives:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Taking a separated key that is incremented every time the bitmap is modified. This can be very efficient and atomic using a small Redis Lua script.</li> 
  <li>Running the bitmap incrementally using the <span href="/commands/bitcount">BITCOUNT</span> <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> optional parameters, accumulating the results client-side, and optionally caching the result into a key.</li> 
 </ul>
